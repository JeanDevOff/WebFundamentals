<p class="intro">
  Interactions between notifications and apps should be seamless.
</p>

## Open notifications to an appropriate place

When the user clicks a notification, always open the app to a contextually appropriate place. For example, if the notification says, "Message from Bard", then clicking that notification should go directly to the message from Barb. It may be tempting to link from a breaking news notification to the top stories section of a web site. But the user probably didn't sign up for that; he wanted to see the braking headline.
